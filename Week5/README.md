# Thermistor

This project uses the thermistor sensor to read the temperature of the environment. When the temperature is below 85째F, then the blue LED will turn on. If the temperature is between 85째F and 87째F, then the green LED will turn on. The red LED will turn on if the temperature is above 87째F. For more information on the project visit this link:
