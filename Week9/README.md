#Week 9: Random Circles

First homework for openframes. This is a simple sketch that allows the user to draw circles on the canvas. The user hits the key 'a' to draw circles of random size and random x and y positions. The color of each circle will be a random r, g, and b value. The user can clear the background by mouse press.
