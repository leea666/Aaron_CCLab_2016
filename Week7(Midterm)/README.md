#Week 7: A Moment of Silence

I used the 8x8 LED matrix to form a heart pattern and a button to trigger the LEDs to turn on. This project was inspired by Quakerism. A Moment of Silence is a common practice within the Quaker community as a form of reflection. Instead of using words and images to reflect, silence is is utilized to gather and center ourselves and thoughts. The "inner light" is a common aim of centering oneself to become truly aware of ourselves. In modern day, we want all of our processes expedited and fast in order to maximize our time. But sometimes there is no room for reflection. It is important to incorporate reflection time in order to appreciate our lives even if it is something small and insignificant to others. We all have something to live for and we should take the time to listen.
