# buttonPushStateChange

This project has the LED change from 1 blink per second to 10 blinks per second whenever the button is pushed. The user must push the button the first time to start the sequence. There is no way to turn off the LED once the sequence has started. That is all.

Also here is the link of the video of it working:
